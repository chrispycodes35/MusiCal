What's uppp teammm. 

The repository has 4 different branches you can work in. **frontend**, **backend**, **design**, **ml**.

If you want to work on the project switch into one of these branches by opening terminal at the folder location and writing **git switch {branch_name}**.

Before starting to write code. Type **git pull origin main** so you can work with the newest version of the project.

Now if you make changes and want to store them write **git add {specific name of folder or file you changed}**. After that you can write **git commit -m "{In the quotations you will write a message talking about what it is you did in the addition you made.}"**

After this you will want to push your code to the origin...**BUT**... please do **git pull origin main** before so you can make sure the code you're working with is up to date with what others have worked on.

Now that you checked that make sure to check if you are in the correct branch by writing **git branch**. If you are in the correct branch then push your changes with **git push**

After doing that you can now create a pull request to the origin so your code can reach the main branch.
