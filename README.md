### What's up, team! 🎶

Welcome to the MusiCal project! Here's a quick guide to help you collaborate smoothly with the team. Follow the steps below to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Branches

We have **4 branches** where you can contribute to different parts of the project:

- `frontend`: For all front-end development (React, HTML, CSS, etc.).
- `backend`: For back-end development (Flask, APIs, etc.).
- `design`: For the UI/UX designs and prototyping.
- `ml`: For machine learning models and related work.

### Switching Branches

1. Open your terminal in the project folder.
2. Switch to the branch you want to work on:
   ```bash
   git switch {branch_name}

### Development Workflow

1. Pull the Latest Code
Before starting any work, always pull the latest version of the project from the main branch to make sure you're up-to-date:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main

3. Work on Your Feature or Fix
Make changes in the codebase according to the branch you're working in.

4. Stage Your Changes
Once you're ready to save your changes, add the files you worked on. You can add specific files or entire folders:
   ```bash
   git add {file_or_folder_name}

6. Commit Your Changes
Write a commit message describing what you did in this update:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

7. Pull Latest Changes from main
Before pushing your changes, make sure you have the latest version of the project:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main

8. Push Your Changes
Once you have the latest code and no conflicts, push your changes to the branch you're working in:
   ```bash
   git push

9. Create a Pull Request (PR)
After pushing your changes, go to GitHub and create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your code into the main branch. Make sure to:

Choose the correct branch as the source.
Add a clear description of what changes you're proposing.
Tag any relevant team members for a review.
