### What's up, team! ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to the MusiCal project! Here's a quick guide to help you collaborate smoothly with the team. Follow the steps below to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Branches

We have **4 branches** where you can contribute to different parts of the project:

- `frontend`: For all front-end development (React, HTML, CSS, etc.).
- `backend`: For back-end development (Flask, APIs, etc.).
- `design`: For the UI/UX designs and prototyping.
- `ml`: For machine learning models and related work.

### Switching Branches

1. Open your terminal in the project folder.
2. Switch to the branch you want to work on:
   ```bash
   git switch {branch_name}

### Development Workflow

1. Pull the Latest Code
- Before starting any work, always pull the latest version of the project from the main branch to make sure you're up-to-date:
  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main

3. Work on Your Feature or Fix
- Make changes in the codebase according to the branch you're working in.

4. Stage Your Changes
- Once you're ready to save your changes, add the files you worked on. You can add specific files or entire folders:
  
   ```bash
   git add {file_or_folder_name}

6. Commit Your Changes
- Write a commit message describing what you did in this update:
  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

7. Pull Latest Changes from main
- Before pushing your changes, make sure you have the latest version of the project:
  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main

8. Push Your Changes
- Once you have the latest code and no conflicts, push your changes to the branch you're working in:
  
   ```bash
   git push {branch_name}

9. Create a Pull Request (PR)
- After pushing your changes, go to GitHub and create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your code into the main branch. Make sure to:

Choose the correct branch as the source.
Add a clear description of what changes you're proposing.
Tag any relevant team members for a review.
